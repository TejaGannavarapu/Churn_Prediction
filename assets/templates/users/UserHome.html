            <p style="color: #fff">In current days, the customers are getting more
                attracted towards the quality of service (QoS) provided by the
                organizations. However, the current era is evidencing higher
                competition in providing technologically advanced QoS to the
                customers. Nevertheless, efficient customer relationship
                management systems can be advantageous for the organization
                for gaining more customers, maintaining customer relationships
                and improve customer retention by adding more profit to the
                organizational business. Furthermore, the machine learning
                models such as support vector machine algorithms can add more
                value to the customer retention strategies. </p>
